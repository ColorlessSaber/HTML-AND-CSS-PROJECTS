		<h1>The Lore of the Bionicle</h1>
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fime before time, the Great Spirit decended from the heavens, carrying we, the ones called
		the Matoran, to this island paradise. We were separate and without purpose, so the Great Spirit blessed
		us with three virtues: unity, duty, and destiny. We embraced these gifts and, in gratitude, we named our
		island home Mata Nui, after the Great Spirit himself.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;But our happiness was not to last. Mata Nui’s brother, Makuta, was jealous of these hon­ors and betrayed him.
		Makuta cast a spell over Mata Nui, who fell into a deep slumber. Makuta’s power dominated the land, as fields
		withered away, sunlight grew cold, and ancient values were forgotten.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, all hope was not lost. Legends told of six mighty heroes, the Toa, who would arrive to save Mata Nui.
		Time would reveal that these were not simply myths — for the Toa did appear on the shores of the island.
		They arrived with no memory, no knowledge of one another — but they pledged to defend Mata Nui and its people
		against the darkness. Great warriors with great power, drawn from the very elements themselves.
		Together, they were six he­roes with one destiny: to defeat Makuta and save Mata Nui.<br>
		This is their story.<br>
